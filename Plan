Goal:
  - Be able to predict which teams are most likely to sustain late season success
  - Find an approximation per position of how many snaps increase the risk of injury
  - Pool snap counts with NFL experience and age for deeper analysis
  - Assist with coaches' player rotations and sustained success
  - Gather insights for players hisotrical wear and tear
  - Manage player "loads" to give full roster playing experience and increase roster depth
Process:
  - Gather snap count data for starting players by position
      - Find total snap counts, snap percentages, snaps missed due to injury
      - FantasyPros
  - Produce an equation that calculates how many games a player misses on average per snap played
      - Snaps missed due to injury for RBs / Total snaps played by RBs ?
  - Use insights to see how many games a player will miss if x amount of snaps
  - Find a centerpoint for optimal amount of snaps played to reduce injury (per season, per game, per possesion)
  - Take results and predict which teams are most likely to retain most starters in a season, thus more wins
